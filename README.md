This is a more efficient version of my old ITGS project from High School (Encoding-Program)

You need at least VScode to use it for now.

Run main.py for the program. Run Test Library for robot framework.

General Steps:

1. Run Main.py
2. Create Credentials (4 in terminal)
3. Create Account (1 in terminal)
4. Encrypt/Decrypt as needed
